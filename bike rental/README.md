# Bike Rental System

This is a simple Python-based Bike Rental System implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The system simulates the operations of renting bikes from a bike shop.

## Features
- **Display Available Stock**: Shows the total number of bikes currently available for rent.
- **Rent a Bike**: Allows users to rent a specified number of bikes. The system checks if there are enough bikes available and calculates the total cost based on the rental price per bike.
- **Exit**: Ends the program.

## How it Works
- When you run the program, you will be presented with three options: 
  1. Display the available bikes in the shop.
  2. Rent bikes (choose the quantity).
  3. Exit the program.
  
- The rental price per bike is set to 100 units (can be modified in the code).
- If the user attempts to rent more bikes than the available stock, the system will prompt for a valid quantity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
