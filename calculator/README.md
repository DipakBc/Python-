# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator application implemented in Python. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (note: division by zero is handled).
- **Quit**: Exits the program.

## How it Works
1. The program asks the user to choose an operation:
   - For addition, press 1.
   - For subtraction, press 2.
   - For multiplication, press 3.
   - For division, press 4.
   - To quit the program, press 5.
2. The user is prompted to enter two numbers to perform the chosen operation.
3. The result is displayed, and the user can choose to perform another operation or quit.

## Error Handling
- The program handles invalid input with appropriate error messages.
- Division by zero is managed to prevent errors during the calculation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
