# Expense Tracker

This Python-based Expense Tracker system allows you to track your daily expenses, view all expenses, and calculate the total expenses. 

## Features
- **Add Expense**: Allows the user to add a new expense by entering the date, description, and amount.
- **View Expenses**: Displays all the recorded expenses.
- **Calculate Total**: Computes the total of all expenses.
- **Save and Load Data**: Expenses are saved in a text file (`expenses.txt`) for persistence. The system loads the saved expenses when the program is restarted.

## How It Works
1. Run the program, and you will be presented with a menu to choose from:
   - Add an expense.
   - View all expenses.
   - Calculate total expenses.
   - Exit the program.

2. For adding an expense:
   - Enter the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
   - Provide a description for the expense.
   - Enter the expense amount.

3. The system will automatically save all expenses to `expenses.txt`.
